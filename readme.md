#Sendy API Addons

##Query

[query.php](query.php) is a robust api that allows querying of campaigns based on name/label. 

It provides a detailed report consisting of total recepients, clicks, rates, and more. 

See [query.php#26](query.php#26) for detailed information about the fields returned.

##Links and Reports
[links.php](links.php) and [reports.php](reports.php) were forked from [jamescridland/links.php](https://gist.github.com/jamescridland/4a5e013c5d5edbcd99ded61412a16568) and [jamescridland/reports.php](https://gist.github.com/jamescridland/1f4ea72fbd262fa31850ccfd5a54df0a) and updated in 2024 for Sendy v6.1.1

They enable you to pull campaign specific data utilizing an API call that specifies a campaign by title/label.
